description: Hello, I'm Santosh. I am building Cellular Networks for the past 10 years.

I started my learnings from 4G in 2013, contributing to timing synchronization and very recently I got my PhD in 2023. I love building wireless networks. 
I contributed to Cellular Standards, built modems, hack modems too!. My work is demonstrated at prestigious Mobile World Congress twice!.

Towards the end of my PhD, AI fever took over and Telecom industry is at crossroads of whether to go Open or Closed.
5G almost was an experimental standard. Hmm.. Let's be optimistic and build a better future for 6G "Together"

Few of my accomplishments

* Built world's first NB-IoT all software modem, 2016
* Contributed to Narrow-band IoT standards
* Solved mmWave beam-management 
* Key player in IoT startup
* Built a startup in mmWave 5G
* Ask me anything in Cellular Standards
* Hacked several modems
* Built wireless man-in-the-middle in 5G
